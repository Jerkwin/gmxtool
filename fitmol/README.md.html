# Introduction

This FitMol Fortran program is designed to perform a rotation on a molecule such that it minimizes the RMSD of its coordinates with respect to a __reference__ molecule.

# Compiling

Before running the program, you should compile the `FitMol.f90` file, using a suitable Fortran compiler. Examples of possible compile commands are:

```
ifort    FitMol.f90 -o fitmol.exe
gfortran FitMol.f90 -o fitmol.exe
```

# Running

## interactive

After compiling, this is how to use the `fitmol` program interactively(See more details following, regarding how to prepare the input file):

1. Call the program via    `./fitmol.exe`
2. Program will ask for name of the input `.xyz` file.
3. Enter the name, less the `.xyz` extension.
4. Program will ask if you want to fit now.
5. Enter `y` and return.

This program will then print to the screen the rotation matrix determined for the test molecule, as well as some other information.

### multiple fitting

More than one molecule can be fitted at the same time. To do this, the first molecule
in the `.xyz` file must be the reference molecule. As many other molecules as you wish can
be concatenated below it.

### center

By default, the center of rotation is the geometrical center of the molecule in each `.xyz` file. If you want to use a different center of rotation, make the first character(s) of the `.xyz` comment line match the atom number you wish to use.

For example, the following file has only two molecules in it, and is requesting that `fitmol` use the 4th atom as the center of rotation:

```c

C        -1.48058263    0.37621359    0.00000000

H        -4.13399585    4.93813311    2.80466484
```

### weighting

Additionally, if you wish to give special weight/importance to certain atoms during the fitting/rotation, you can list their weight(s) next to them in the reference structure.

For example, the following file is letting `fitmol` use the center of geometry as the center of rotation, but has given special weight to the `C` atom:

```c
5
4 ref
C            -1.48058263    0.37621359    0.00000000   20.0
H            -1.12392821   -0.63259642    0.00000000    1.0

```

### output

The program will produce an output file called `<input_filename>~Fit.xyz`, which is a valid `.xyz` file of all the molecules, and the non-reference molecules have been rotated according to the RMSD-minimizing rotation matrices. In addition, the weights of the reference molecule are printed, and the RMSD of each fitted molecule is printed in its comment line.

For example, this file shows two identical methane molecules using no special weights, so that upon rotation, an RMSD of zero was obtained:

```cpp

H     -1.070000019   0.000013274   0.000000000
```

## non-interactive

Alternatively, the program can be run non-interactively by simply giving the name of the input file. For example, the following syntax would execute the `fitmol` program on a file called `ch4.xyz`:

```
./fitmol.exe ch4
```

For non-interactive execution, the center of rotation can be defined with a second commandline argument. For example,  the following syntax would execute the `fitmol` program on a file called `ch4.xyz`, using atom #1 as the rotation center:

```
./fitmol.exe ch4 1
```

## TODO

1. maximum number of atoms is fixed to 2000. Using allocatable array.
2. <del>all molecules should have the same numner of atoms.</del>
3. <del>fitting and RMSD calculation use different set of atoms.</del>
